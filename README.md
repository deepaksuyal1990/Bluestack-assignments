The folder contains solutions to the given problems

**Problem 1:**

Suppose I have a red block (R) of height 1, a blue block (B) of height 2, and a green block (G) of height 3. I can stack the blocks one above the other to build a tower. For example, I can stack in the order RBG and I would get a tower of height 6. I wish to compute how many different towers of a given height n can be built if there are ample blocks of each colour.

Let T(N) denote the number of towers of height n. Write a python program that prints T(N) given any integer N.

**Problem 2:**

Write a python program that would generate a result similar to what  “ls -al” command does on unix machines. 
The program should return following details 

1. Count of files + directories (integer value, sum of count of files & count of directions in the current folder)
2. Name of the file/directory (should support non-ascii characters)
3. F for file, D for directory
4. Size of the file in KB (not required for directories)
5. Created date 

**Problem 3**

Create an HTML page which has
1.	Three input fields which accept different inputs (dd/mm/yyyy format)
2.	A submit button
3.	On clicking the submit button, the page should display the next calendar date
Example: if a user enters 31/05/2020 in the input fields and clicks ‘Submit’, the result should be 01/06/2020
